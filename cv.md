### About myself
My name is Artem, and I'm 25 years old. I have several years of experience in programming CNC machines, where I actively utilized my skills and knowledge to create efficient and automated processes. However, I have made the decision to pursue a new profession in the field of front-end development. To achieve this goal, I have chosen the RSSchool, where I am receiving training and practical skills in front-end development. My passion for programming and my drive for personal growth enable me to quickly grasp new concepts and programming languages. I am confident that my experience in programming CNC machines, combined with the knowledge I am acquiring during my education at RSSchool, will allow me to bring value and efficiency to the role of a web developer.
